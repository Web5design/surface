# Substance Surface

Substance Surface is an *in browser* multi-line plain text editing control. It provides a low-level interface for general text manipulation, insertion, deletion et. al. and user-defined range based annotations.
Surface exposes an API that will make it possible to build more complex text editors on top of it.

You can see a working demo in the official [Substance website](http://interior.substance.io/modules/surface.html)
